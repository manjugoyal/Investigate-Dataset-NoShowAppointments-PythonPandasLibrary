# Investigate-Dataset-NoShowAppointments-PythonPandasLibrary
This project was done as a part of data analysis nanodegree a Udacity. The intent of the project is to do an analysis 
for No show appointment data of patients in Brazil using Python. The entire analysis was done in Python 3 using Jupyter 
notebook and the results were also downloaded and stored in a html file. 
The html report can be read as I share my line of thought and code in that.
